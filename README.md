Cove is a implementation of the WebFishing network protocall in a CLI meaning it dosent require Godot or anything other than Steamworks!

# Todo

- [ ] Move entire server into a Program class (idk why .net gave me a classless program)
- [ ] Improve error handling
- [ ] Improve GoDot serialization both ways
- [ ] Add proper support for actor handling (its okay atm)
- [ ] Add spawns for metal detector items
- [ ] Some sort of plugin or modding support (maybe)
